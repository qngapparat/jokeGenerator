Using the icndb.com JSON API to retrieve and parse Chuck Norris jokes using various filters and specifiers provided by the API.
### Notes
* Since I'm not familiar with regular expressions and don't like to use what I don't fully understand, I chose another, perhaps more common approach by using org.json. The required .jar for the JSONObject() and JSONArray() functionality is included in the filepath.
