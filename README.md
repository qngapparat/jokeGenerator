# Chuck Norris joke fetcher
Using the icndb.com JSON API to retrieve and parse Chuck Norris jokes using various filters and specifiers provided by the API.
### Notes
* Instead of Regular Expressions, I used the org.json libary, since I had no time to familiarize myself with the concept of the former. I might swap org.json for Regular Expressions on a later commit. A .jar version of the required org.json libary mandatory to execute the program is included in the directory.
